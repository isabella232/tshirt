                        <h3>Why A T-Shirt?</h3>
                        <p>We wanted to see the hidden world behind clothes sold in this country, so we decided to make a T-shirt. We wanted to make an ordinary shirt like the vast majority of the shirts sold in this country &mdash; not organic cotton, not hand-sewn in the United States.</p>

                        <p>To figure out how many shirts to make, and to raise money to pay for them, we turned to <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/planetmoney/planet-money-t-shirt" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>. Our goal was to sell 2,000 shirts. In the end, we sold 25,000.</p>
                        <p>(Thanks again to everyone who ordered a shirt. Really. Amazing. We couldn&rsquo;t have done it without you!)</p>


                        <h3>Why A Squirrel?</h3>
                        <p>The design on the shirt, a squirrel hoisting a martini glass, is a visual pun: a reference to the phrase &ldquo;animal spirits&rdquo; made famous by the economist John Maynard Keynes.</p>
                        <p>As Planet Money&rsquo;s David Kestenbaum <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/04/30/180079862/episode-455-the-planet-money-t-shirt-is-finally-almost-here" target="_blank">put it recently</a>: &ldquo;Keynes&rsquo; idea was that there&rsquo;s more to the markets than just numbers; there are people and emotions making decisions. And to the extent that we are finding the human element in the very dry subject of economics, it&rsquo;s actually perfect for us.&rdquo;</p>

                        <h3>10 Reporters, 3 Continents, 1 Archipelago</h3>
                        <p>We flew drones over Mississippi. We got mugged in Chittagong, Bangladesh. We met people whom we&rsquo;ll never forget &mdash; the actual people who make our clothing. At every location we had radio reporters and videographers.</p>

                        <h3>A Little Help From Our Friends</h3>
                        <p>Adam Davidson, Planet Money co-founder, came up with the idea of doing this project in the first place more than three years ago.</p>
                        <p>We were inspired a lot by a book: <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470287160/?SubscriptionId=AKIAJNA3QS2AGVCXHCCA&tag=npr-5-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=0470287160" target="_blank">The Travels Of A T-shirt In The Global Economy</a></em>. In fact, we hired the author, Pietra Rivoli, to be an adviser on the project. She&rsquo;s a professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University.</p>

                        <div class="about-callout">

                        	<p>Bawen, Indonesia: Jess Jiang faces the classic producer&rsquo;s dilemma: One machine tells a story. A thousand create a racket. </p>
                        </div>

                        <p>After several years of trying and failing to make a T-shirt from scratch, we finally found some help from Jockey Corp. Marion Smith, the director of global sourcing for Jockey, was patient with us on the phone. (T-shirts are knitted, not woven. They&rsquo;re made from something that looks like thread but is called yarn.) Eventually, Jockey agreed to sell us T-shirts &mdash; and, more important, to let us follow the creation of those shirts.</p>

                        <p>The Planet Money T-shirts are made of fabric that Jockey&rsquo;s textile experts developed. They&rsquo;re based on a design pattern Jockey uses for its own T-shirt line. Jockey introduced us to its suppliers in Bangladesh and Colombia, and those suppliers agreed to assemble our shirts. And Jockey designers helped us pick out the colors for our shirts.</p>
